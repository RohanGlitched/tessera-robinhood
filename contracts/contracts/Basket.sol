/// @title Tessera basket
/// @notice A permissionless, in-kind index basket of Robinhood Stock Tokens.
///
/// A basket is a fixed recipe: for one whole share, hand the vault
/// `unitsPerShare` raw units of each component and receive one share token.
/// Burn a share and the vault hands the components back, pro rata.
///
/// Everything settles in kind. The contract never reads a price, so a stale or
/// manipulated oracle cannot mis-price a mint or a redemption, and the vault can
/// never be under-collateralised: deposits round up and withdrawals round down,
/// so rounding dust always stays with the vault and every holder.
///
/// Robinhood Stock Tokens apply corporate actions (splits, dividends) through a
/// multiplier on the token, not by moving raw balances out of holders. A raw-unit
/// recipe is therefore untouched by corporate actions, and whatever accrues to
/// the token accrues to every share automatically.
///
/// The recipe is written once, at construction, and has no setter. There is no
/// owner, no pause and no upgrade path.
